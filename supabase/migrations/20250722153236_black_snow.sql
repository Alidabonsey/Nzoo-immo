  # Fix RLS policies for spaces table

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow both anonymous and authenticated users
    - This resolves the "new row violates row-level security policy" error
    - Allows the admin dashboard to work without requiring Supabase authentication

  2. Modified Policies
    - View spaces: Allow anon and authenticated users
    - Insert spaces: Allow anon and authenticated users  
    - Update spaces: Allow anon and authenticated users
    - Delete spaces: Allow anon and authenticated users

  Note: This is a temporary solution for development. In production, 
  proper authentication should be implemented.
